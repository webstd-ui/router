# Beads Claude Code Plugin

AI-supervised issue tracker for coding workflows. Manage tasks, discover work, and maintain context with simple slash commands and MCP tools.

## What is Beads?

Beads (`bd`) is an issue tracker designed specifically for AI-supervised coding workflows. It helps AI agents and developers:

-   Track work with a simple CLI
-   Discover and link related tasks during development
-   Maintain context across coding sessions
-   Auto-sync issues via JSONL for git workflows

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize beads in your project
/bd-init

# Create your first issue
/bd-create "Set up project structure" feature 1

# See what's ready to work on
/bd-ready

# Show full workflow guide
/bd-workflow
```

## Available Commands

### Version Management

-   **`/bd-version`** - Check bd CLI, plugin, and MCP server versions

### Core Workflow Commands

-   **`/bd-ready`** - Find tasks with no blockers, ready to work on
-   **`/bd-create [title] [type] [priority]`** - Create a new issue interactively
-   **`/bd-show [issue-id]`** - Show detailed information about an issue
-   **`/bd-update [issue-id] [status]`** - Update issue status or other fields
-   **`/bd-close [issue-id] [reason]`** - Close a completed issue

### Project Management

-   **`/bd-init`** - Initialize beads in the current project
-   **`/bd-workflow`** - Show the AI-supervised issue workflow guide
-   **`/bd-stats`** - Show project statistics and progress

### Agents

-   **`@task-agent`** - Autonomous agent that finds and completes ready tasks

## MCP Tools Available

The plugin includes a full-featured MCP server with these tools:

-   **`init`** - Initialize bd in current directory
-   **`create`** - Create new issue (bug, feature, task, epic, chore)
-   **`list`** - List issues with filters (status, priority, type, assignee)
-   **`ready`** - Find tasks with no blockers ready to work on
-   **`show`** - Show detailed issue info including dependencies
-   **`update`** - Update issue (status, priority, design, notes, etc)
-   **`close`** - Close completed issue
-   **`dep`** - Add dependency (blocks, related, parent-child, discovered-from)
-   **`blocked`** - Get blocked issues
-   **`stats`** - Get project statistics

### MCP Resources

-   **`beads://quickstart`** - Interactive quickstart guide

## Workflow

The beads workflow is designed for AI agents but works great for humans too:

1. **Find ready work**: `/bd-ready`
2. **Claim your task**: `/bd-update <id> in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work**: Create issues for bugs/TODOs found during work
5. **Complete**: `/bd-close <id> "Done: <summary>"`
6. **Repeat**: Check for newly unblocked tasks

## Issue Types

-   **`bug`** - Something broken that needs fixing
-   **`feature`** - New functionality
-   **`task`** - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
-   **`epic`** - Large feature composed of multiple issues
-   **`chore`** - Maintenance work (dependencies, tooling)

## Priority Levels

-   **`0`** - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
-   **`1`** - High (major features, important bugs)
-   **`2`** - Medium (nice-to-have features, minor bugs)
-   **`3`** - Low (polish, optimization)
-   **`4`** - Backlog (future ideas)

## Dependency Types

-   **`blocks`** - Hard dependency (issue X blocks issue Y from starting)
-   **`related`** - Soft relationship (issues are connected)
-   **`parent-child`** - Epic/subtask relationship
-   **`discovered-from`** - Track issues discovered during work

Only `blocks` dependencies affect the ready work queue.

## Configuration

### Auto-Approval Configuration

By default, Claude Code asks for confirmation every time the beads MCP server wants to run a command. This is a security feature, but it can disrupt workflow during active development.

**Available Options:**

#### 1. Auto-Approve All Beads Tools (Recommended for Trusted Projects)

Add to your Claude Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "enabledMcpjsonServers": ["beads"]
}
```

This auto-approves all beads commands without prompting.

#### 2. Auto-Approve Project MCP Servers

Add to your Claude Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "enableAllProjectMcpServers": true
}
```

This auto-approves all MCP servers defined in your project's `.mcp.json` file. Useful when working across multiple projects with different MCP requirements.

#### 3. Manual Approval (Default)

No configuration needed. Claude Code will prompt for approval on each MCP tool invocation.

**Security Trade-offs:**

-   **Manual approval (default)**: Maximum safety, but interrupts workflow frequently
-   **Server-level auto-approval**: Convenient for trusted projects, but allows any beads operation without confirmation
-   **Project-level auto-approval**: Good balance for multi-project workflows with project-specific trust levels

**Limitation:** Claude Code doesn't currently support per-tool approval granularity. You cannot auto-approve only read operations (like `bd ready`, `bd show`) while requiring confirmation for mutations (like `bd create`, `bd update`). It's all-or-nothing at the server level.

**Recommended Configuration:**

For active development on trusted projects where you're frequently using beads:

```json
{
    "enabledMcpjsonServers": ["beads"]
}
```

For more information, see the [Claude Code settings documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings).

### Environment Variables

The MCP server supports these environment variables:

-   **`BEADS_PATH`** - Path to bd executable (default: `bd` in PATH)
-   **`BEADS_DB`** - Path to beads database file (default: auto-discover from cwd)
-   **`BEADS_ACTOR`** - Actor name for audit trail (default: `$USER`)
-   **`BEADS_NO_AUTO_FLUSH`** - Disable automatic JSONL sync (default: `false`)
-   **`BEADS_NO_AUTO_IMPORT`** - Disable automatic JSONL import (default: `false`)

To customize, edit your Claude Code MCP settings or the plugin configuration.

## Examples

### Basic Task Management

```bash
# Create a high-priority bug
/bd-create "Fix authentication" bug 1

# See ready work
/bd-ready

# Start working on bd-10
/bd-update bd-10 in_progress

# Complete the task
/bd-close bd-10 "Fixed auth token validation"
```

### Discovering Work During Development

```bash
# Working on bd-10, found a related bug
/bd-create "Add rate limiting to API" feature 2

# Link it to current work (via MCP tool)
# Use `dep` tool: issue="bd-11", depends_on="bd-10", type="discovered-from"

# Close original task
/bd-close bd-10 "Done, discovered bd-11 for rate limiting"
```

### Using the Task Agent

```bash
# Let the agent find and complete ready work
@task-agent

# The agent will:
# 1. Find ready work with `ready` tool
# 2. Claim a task by updating status
# 3. Execute the work
# 4. Create issues for discoveries
# 5. Close when complete
# 6. Repeat
```

## Auto-Sync with Git

Beads automatically syncs issues to `.beads/issues.jsonl`:

-   **Export**: After any CRUD operation (5-second debounce)
-   **Import**: When JSONL is newer than DB (e.g., after `git pull`)

This enables seamless collaboration:

```bash
# Make changes
bd create "Add feature" -p 1

# Changes auto-export after 5 seconds
# Commit when ready
git add .beads/issues.jsonl
git commit -m "Add feature tracking"

# After pull, JSONL auto-imports
git pull
bd ready  # Fresh data from git!
```

## Updating

The beads plugin has three components that may need updating:

### 1. Plugin Updates

Check for plugin updates:

```bash
/plugin update beads
```

Claude Code will pull the latest version from GitHub. After updating, **restart Claude Code** to apply MCP server changes.

### 2. bd CLI Updates

The plugin requires the `bd` CLI to be installed. Update it separately:

```bash
# Quick update
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveyegge/beads/main/install.sh | bash

# Or with go
go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
```

### 3. Version Compatibility

The MCP server **automatically checks** bd CLI version on startup and will fail with a clear error if your version is too old.

Check version compatibility manually:

```bash
/bd-version
```

This will show:

-   bd CLI version
-   Plugin version
-   MCP server status
-   Compatibility warnings if versions mismatch

**Recommended update workflow:**

1. Check versions: `/bd-version`
2. Update bd CLI if needed (see above)
3. Update plugin: `/plugin update beads`
4. Restart Claude Code
5. Verify: `/bd-version`

### Version Numbering

Beads follows semantic versioning. The plugin version tracks the bd CLI version:

-   Plugin 0.9.2 requires bd CLI >= 0.9.0 (checked automatically at startup)
-   Major version bumps may introduce breaking changes
-   Check CHANGELOG.md for release notes

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not appearing

1. Check installation: `/plugin list`
2. Restart Claude Code
3. Verify `bd` is in PATH: `which bd`
4. Check uv is installed: `which uv`

### MCP server not connecting

1. Check MCP server list: `/mcp`
2. Look for "beads" server with plugin indicator
3. Restart Claude Code to reload MCP servers
4. Check logs for errors

### Commands not working

1. Make sure you're in a project with beads initialized: `/bd-init`
2. Check if database exists: `ls -la .beads/`
3. Try direct MCP tool access instead of slash commands
4. Check the beads CLI works: `bd --help`

### MCP tool errors

1. Verify `bd` executable location: `BEADS_PATH` env var
2. Check `bd` works in terminal: `bd stats`
3. Review MCP server logs in Claude Code
4. Try reinitializing: `/bd-init`
