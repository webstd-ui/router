# Remix 3 Contacts (SPA)

A version of the [React Router address book tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/tutorials/address-book) using my Remix 3 [client-side router](/packages/remix-client-router/router/router.ts) for `@remix-run/dom`, utilizing `@remix-run/events` and `@remix-run/fetch-router`.

To start the development server, [install Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html) and run:

```sh
mise install
mise run :dev
```
